# Trump Tweet Trivia

## CAUTION: This app has audio! (But it's worth it...)

## Directions:
You will have 15 seconds to decide if the Tweet displayed is from Trump or someone else.
* Pick YES if you think Trump tweeted it.
* Pick NO if you think Trump did not tweet it.
* BEST EXPERIENCE will be to pick all the wrong answers :)
